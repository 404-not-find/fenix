# Fenix Web Servers

Fenix is a desktop web server for developers. Check out [fenixwebserver.com](http://fenixwebserver.com) for details.

The [wiki](https://github.com/coreybutler/fenix/wiki) has additional information about how Fenix works, how to hack on it,
and how to use it on other platforms.  The [release history](https://github.com/coreybutler/fenix/releases) has older versions and a changelog.

Making a donation will go towards the development of Fenix. At the moment, I'd love to reach a simple goal of $100 in  _annual_ contributions so I can obtain an Apple Developer license for Fenix... which is the only application I'm distributing on Mac. This would help prevent the "Cannot install from unidentified developer" error some Mac users receive. Other contributions would go towards future efforts like hosting a public SSH tunnel (to take some load off localtunnel.me) and new feature development.
