# Issue Update (5/15/2014 11:23am CST)

Somehow, some way, an old version of the Mac app overwrote the latest release in v2.0.0. This version has an issue that causes the program to hang on startup. I'm rebuilding the latest release now. The Windows version is up to date. I'll remvoe this notice as soon as the proper version is uploaded. Sorry for any inconvenience!

Like Fenix?

Making a donation will go towards the development of Fenix. At the moment, I'd love to reach a simple goal of $100 in  _annual_ contributions so I can obtain an Apple Developer license for Fenix... which is the only application I'm distributing on Mac. This would help prevent the "Cannot install from unidentified developer" annoyance some OSX Mavericks users experience. Other contributions would go towards future efforts like hosting a public SSH tunnel (to take some load off localtunnel.me) and new feature development.
