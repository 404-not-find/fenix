# Fenix

Fenix is a desktop application for launching ad-hoc static web servers.
It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Fenix was designed as a development tool. It is **not for production use**.
Use it to launch one or more ad-hoc web servers (static).

There's a [website](https://coreybutler.github.com/fenix) where you can see
Fenix in action and download a free copy to use.

I also wrote a little about the [inspiration for this project](http://artofidea.com/cookbook/development/fenix).
