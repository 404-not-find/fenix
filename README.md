# Fenix

Fenix is a desktop application for launching ad-hoc static web servers.
It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Fenix was designed as a development tool. It is **not for production use**.
However; it can be quite useful in development. Use it to launch one or
more ad-hoc static servers. Provide each server a unique port number and
web root, then fire it up. That's really all there is to it. When done,
shut it down. The settings are saved, so the next time you boot up your
computer, you won't have to re-enter your configurations.

There's a [website](http://coreybutler.github.com/fenix) where you can see
Fenix in action and download a free copy to use.

I also wrote a little about the [inspiration for this project](http://artofidea.com/cookbook/development/fenix).
